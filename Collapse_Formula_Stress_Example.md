# 📎 Collapse Formula Applied: Small Example in Material Stress

This example shows how to use the collapse formula in a real-world situation **outside of fluid dynamics** — specifically, detecting pre-fracture behavior in a 1D steel bar under tension.

## 🧪 Problem

You have a steel bar under increasing tensile stress. You measure the stress at 5 evenly spaced points:

```
σ = [200, 230, 300, 320, 325]  # stress in MPa
```

The material hasn’t reached its yield strength (350 MPa), so classical analysis says it’s safe. But what if a fracture is building?

---

## 🧮 Collapse Formula

We use the symbolic collapse formula:

```
collapse = δϕ² · H(δϕ − κc)
```

Where:

- `ϕ` = gradient of stress (∇σ)
- `δϕ` = how fast that gradient is changing
- `κc` = critical threshold (set here to 35)
- `H(...)` = Heaviside step function (1 if input > 0, else 0)

---

## 📊 Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Compute Stress Gradients

```
ϕ₁ = 230 - 200 = 30
ϕ₂ = 300 - 230 = 70
ϕ₃ = 320 - 300 = 20
```

So:
```
ϕ = [30, 70, 20]
```

---

### Step 2: Compute Gradient of Gradient

```
δϕ at x2 = 70 - 30 = 40
δϕ at x3 = 20 - 70 = -50
```

---

### Step 3: Square δϕ

```
δϕ² = [1600, 2500]
```

---

### Step 4: Apply Threshold κc = 35

Check:
- 40 > 35 → H = 1 → collapse = 1600
- -50 < 35 → H = 0 → collapse = 0

**Final collapse field:**
```
collapse = [1600, 0]
```

---

## ✅ Interpretation

- Classical method: “Stress < yield → safe”
- Collapse method: “Point x2 shows rising internal tension → pre-failure forming”

This model shows **early warning**, not late reaction.

---

## 🧠 Summary

This single formula:

```
collapse = δϕ² · H(δϕ − κc)
```

Can detect structural collapse **before** classical models do — using just field shape. It works across domains, and this example proves that in a real stress scenario.

More domains coming soon (neural signals, heat spikes, economic data).
