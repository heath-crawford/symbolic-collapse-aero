# 🧠 BSD Symbolic Collapse (Post-Zero Disproof)

This directory contains a symbolic disproof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture using a Post-Zero entropy collapse framework.

### 🔁 Collapse Insight

Classic BSD expects:
ord_s=1 L(E, s) = rank(E)

But in Post-Zero collapse:
- Zero behaves as a floating boundary
- The entropy slopes on each side of s = 1 diverge
- Collapse occurs when Δϕ > κ_c before analytic behavior stabilizes
